# EGScript

EGScript is a scripting language made for games, based on [nickcano's fork of improvements](https://github.com/nickcano/signalscript) of [Jeremic's tibiasignal scripting language](https://code.google.com/archive/p/tibiasignal/source/default/source), translated from C++ to C#, with added features (new features include tables, +=, -= operators).

## TODO
* Global variables
* Modulo (%) and exponent (^) operators
* Improved classes (private access modifier)
